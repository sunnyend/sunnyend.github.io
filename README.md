# pokeDEX
This pokeDEX model was taken from a youtube class. I chose this project in specific cause I like both js and pokemon, so why not? Also, i'm studying APIs for now.
Really, REALLY incomplete, but i wanted to publish this since I'm really liking it.

There are a few TODOs that aren't included in the youtube class.</br>

<ul>
  <li>first one was a shiny button that switches forms onclick event.</li>
<li>ability to switch between front and back views when clicking on a DPAD.</li>
<li>ability to change the generation sprite (ie pokemon black, red, etc etc) </li>
 On a side note, I think this will be really hard to achieve, so I'm leaving this to the end.
<li>vectorize the pokeDEX png to svg, since i'm not really a big fan of its quality right now</li> </ul>
